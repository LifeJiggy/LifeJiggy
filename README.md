# 👋 Hi, I'm Stephen — Security Researcher | Bug Bounty Hunter | Cyber Alchemist

I'm a multidisciplinary **security researcher and offensive developer** with a mission: **to uncover hidden flaws before they become breaches**.  
From code to binaries, AI prompts to zero-days — I hunt vulnerabilities across the stack to make systems safer, smarter, and more resilient.

🔐 **"Many roles, one goal"**:  
Bug Bounty Hunter • Software Developer • AI Engineer • Reverse Engineer • Prompt Alchemist

## 🔍 What I Do

I don’t just find bugs — I **reverse-engineer systems**, **build offensive tools**, and **engineer exploits** that expose deep architectural flaws.

- Hunting **0-day, Critical, High, Meduim Vulnerabilities** in web, network and mobile apps
- Developing **Web Crawler, Mapper**, **AI-powered chatbot, real-live project and security tools** and **smart fuzzers**
- Reverse engineering closed-source software and protocols
- Writing **exploits** for memory corruption, logic flaws, and race conditions
- Engineering **obscure prompt injections** to test AI system integrity

🎯 My goal? **Protect by exposing.**  
Every flaw I uncover is a breach *prevented*, a system *hardened*, a lesson *learned*.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Advanced **binary exploitation** and kernel-level vulnerabilities
- **Bug bounty hunting**
- **AI/ML security**: Adversarial attacks, data poisoning, model theft
- **Automated vulnerability discovery** using code analysis + AI
- **Firmware hacking** and embedded device security (IoT/OT)
- Building **open-source tools** for the security community

---

## 💞️ Let's Collaborate
I'm always open to working with:
- Security researchers on **bug bounty teams** or **private programs**
- Developers building **secure-by-design** applications
